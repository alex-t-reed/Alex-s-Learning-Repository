# Welcome to Alex's Learning Repository

This repository is a dedicated space for me to revisit and deepen my understanding of key coding principles. My focus is on honing my programming skills, particularly in areas such as data structures, algorithms, and best practices. I also may include files here for YouTube Shorts and TikTok tutorials that I make! I enjoy teaching others and it also strengthens my own understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders based on programming languages. Currently, I have a section dedicated to Python, with plans to expand to other languages like JavaScript in the future. I also have a LeetCode folder which will then be divided up by programming languages (though I love Python).

## Folders

Where you can find all the files organized by which programming language it is. Subfolders are the folders within each language and I'll try to organize this in a way which makes the most sense.

## My Coding Journey

- 2016: Began learning Python and JavaScript as a freshman at Santa Rosa High School.
- Middle School: Introduced to HTML and CSS through a yearbook class project. Built simple websites for teachers using Weebly.
- Scratch: Learned basic programming concepts like functions and operations, sparking my interest in coding.

### Major Projects

- **MeMoS Study (Python with PsychoPy)**:
Coded the MeMoS Study, aimed at exploring whether intrinsically or extrinsically directed behavior impacts decision strategies for memory-based tasks. The study compares behavior across four performance-based recognition memory tasks: baseline, "do better," memory-focused, and money-focused. Adapted from the classic criterion shifting task by Sara Leslie in 2023, with design planning by Sara Leslie, Courtney Durdle, and Alex Reed. The study was being conducted at the UCSB Miller Memory Lab while supported by a $750 UCSB Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (URCA) grant.

- **Transcript Editor (JavaScript)**:  
  Transcript Editor is a Node.js Express app originally designed for creating transcripts for research purposes for the PADRES Lab at UCSB. It offers several features to facilitate the transcription process:
  - **Formatting**: Automatically makes interviewer lines bold when question marks are used in conjunction with timestamps.
  - **Annotations**: Allows users to add comments, annotations, or descriptions within the transcript using square brackets (e.g., [LAUGHTER]).
  - **User Interface**: The interface consists of a textarea for text input/editing and a div element for displaying the formatted transcript.
  - **Controls**: Provides audio control buttons for managing audio playback and buttons for adding prefixes like "I:" and "P:" for interviewer and participant lines, respectively.

Since then, I've worked on various side projects, some of which are available on my GitHub. Feel free to explore them!

### Current Role

I'm currently working at Access Ingenuity as a *Digital Content Accessibility Specialist*, where I help *automate and process thousands of PDF files for document remediation*. I **develop Python scripts and use PDF scraping libraries along with regular expressions to extract specific information** that will be filled into our Word document templates.
