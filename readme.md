# Welcome to Alex's Learning Repository

This repository is a dedicated space for me to revisit and deepen my understanding of key coding principles. My focus is on honing my programming skills, particularly in areas such as data structures, functions, and library utilization. I also may include files here for YouTube Shorts and TikTok tutorials that I make! I enjoy teaching others and it also strengthens my own understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders based on programming languages. Currently, I have a section dedicated to Python, with plans to expand to other languages like JavaScript in the future.

## Folders

Where you can find all the files organized by which programming language it is. Subfolders are the folders within each language and I'll try to organize this in a way which makes the most sense.

## Backstory

As of February 8, 2025, this repository contains primarily Python-related materials. However, I am actively expanding my knowledge to include additional programming languages.

## My Coding Journey

- 2016: Began learning Python and JavaScript as a freshman at Santa Rosa High School.
- Middle School: Introduced to HTML and CSS through a yearbook class project. Built simple websites for teachers using Weebly.
- Scratch: Learned basic programming concepts like functions and operations, sparking my interest in coding.

Since then, I've worked on various side projects, some of which are available on my GitHub. Feel free to explore them!

**I'm currently working at Access Ingenuity as a *Digital Content Accessibility Specialist***, where I help *automate and process thousands of PDF files for document remediation*. I **develop Python scripts and use PDF scraping libraries along with regular expressions to extract specific information** that will be filled into our Word document templates.
