# Welcome to My Learning Repository

This repository serves as a space for me to revisit and deepen my understanding of key coding principles. My focus is on honing my programming skills, particularly in areas such as data structures, functions, and utilizing libraries.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders based on programming languages. Currently, I have a section dedicated to Python, with plans to expand to other languages like JavaScript in the future.

## Supported Languages

1. [Python](https://github.com/alex-t-reed/Alex-s-Learning-Repository/tree/main/Python)

## Progress and Updates

**As of February 8, 2025**, this repository currently contains Python-related materials. However, I am actively working on expanding my knowledge to include additional programming languages. I have a solid foundation in Python and JavaScript, both of which I began learning in 2016 during my freshman year at Santa Rosa High School.

My coding journey began even earlier in middle school, where I was introduced to HTML and CSS as part of my yearbook class project. I created simple websites for teachers using Weebly, which included assignments and other useful information. I also gained some exposure to JavaScript at that time, although my understanding was limited. A key milestone in my learning was gaining a strong grasp of basic programming concepts such as functions and operations through Scratch. It was an exciting and formative time to be exploring programming!
